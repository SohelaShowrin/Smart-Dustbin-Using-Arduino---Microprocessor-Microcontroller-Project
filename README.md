# Smart-Dustbin-Using-Arduino---Microprocessor-Microcontroller-Project

                                                     Introduction
A dustbin is a large container with a lid which people put their rubbish in and which 
is usually kept outside their house.Dustbin(or garbage bins,trash cans,whatever you can 
call them)are small plastic(or metal) containers that are used to store trash(or waste) on a 
temporary basis. They are often used in homes,offices,streets,park etc.To collect the 
waste.In some places,littering is a serious offence and hence public waste container are 
the only way to dispose small waste.usually, it is a common practice to use separate bins 
for collecting wet or dry,recyclable or non-recyclable waste. In existing method the 
ULTRASONIC SENSOR and SERVO MOTOR is used. Automatic lid opening and 
closing method is used in smart dustbin and microcontroller programming is done in the 
system. A simple but useful project called smart dustbin using arduino is designed and 
developed here.Using this project,the lid of the dustbin stays closed,so that waste is not 
exposed(to avoid flies and mosquitos) and when one wantâ€™s to dispose any waste,it will 
automatically open the lid.

                                                    Importance
The project is important in various way.Here are :
1) Smart dustbins enable efficient waste collection, ensuring timely disposal and 
preventing overflow, which can lead to littering and environmental pollution.
2) With sensors and connectivity, smart dustbins provide real-time data.
3) smart dustbins can help reduce operational costs for waste management 
authorities.
4) Proper waste management contributes to environmental protection by reducing 
pollution and preserving natural resources.
5) Implementing smart dustbins fosters innovation and the adoption of technology in 
traditional waste management systems, leading to more sustainable practices.

                                                   List of equipment
A. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: The Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 is one of the most 
commonly used distance measuring sensors and works extremely well with 
arduino. The time its take the sound wave to be sent, hit the object and return back 
to the sensor is measured.
B. Arduino UNO : Arduino is an open source computer hardware and software com 
pany, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single board . 
The ultrasonic sensor module uses any two digital pins on the Arduino for Trig 
and Echo.
C. Connecting Wire: For the connection of the Ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino mi 
crocontroller by using the jumper wire. A jump wire is an electrical wire or group 
of them in a cable with a connector or pin at each other.
D. SG90 Micro Servo Motor: The SG90 micro servo motor is a versatile and widely 
used component in hobbyist projects, robotics, and various electronic applications. 
Known for its small size and affordability, the SG90 offers precise control over 
angular movement, making it ideal for tasks such as steering mechanisms, robotic 
arms, and other applica tions requiring controlled rotational motion.
E. 9V Power Supply: A 9V power supply is a common and versatile source of 
electrical power for a variety of electronic devices and components. It is widely 
used in applications such as small electronics projects, battery-operated devices, 
and low-power circuits. The 9V battery, a compact and portable option, is 
convenient for providing reliable energy in situations where a compact form factor 
is essential.

                                                   CONCLUSION
Future enhancements for a smart dustbin using Arduino include smart sorting, 
capacity monitoring, energy efficiency, remote monitoring, data analytics, odor control, 
user interaction improvements, integration with smart cities, safety features, and 
community engagement initiatives. Smart dustbins are now the needs of Smart buildings. 
Smart dustbin is a new idea of implementation which makes a normal dustbin 
smart.There is a great scope for the modifications of the Smart Dustbin in the future. The 
system can be improved by adding new functionalities. Dumping of the waste was 
manual in Smart dustbin this can be automated by fixing a robot arm.
